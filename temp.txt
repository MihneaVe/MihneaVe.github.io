PROJECTS
Deepfake Image Classification
Multi-Class ML image classifier03/2025 – 05/2025Competed in an image classification challenge focused on detecting deepfake images 
generated by advanced generative models. Designed and trained custom (non–pre-trained) 
models from scratch, achieving 91% classification accuracy on the test set. Improved 
performance through ensemble learning, grid-search hyperparameter tuning, and data 
augmentation, ensuring robustness against overfitting and distribution shifts.
•Technologies: PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, PillowStochastic Process Simulation & Statistical Modeling
12/2024 – 01/2025Developed an R-based simulation framework to model sequential stage completion times 
with exponential random variables and probabilistic stopping conditions. Approximated 
expectations, probabilities, and distributions of total process times through large-scale 
Monte Carlo simulations (10⁶ runs), and validated against exact analytical results. Built 
interactive Shiny applications to visualize probability distributions (Normal, Exponential, 
Poisson, Binomial) and compute distribution-specific moments. Implemented parameter 
estimation using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Method of Moments, and 
numerical optimization for multiple probability distributions.
•Technologies: R, Shiny, Monte Carlo Simulation, MLE, Statistical Inference, 
Probability Modeling, Data VisualizationAutonomous Agentic AI for Quantum Error Correction
11/2025 – 11/2025Engineered an autonomous Agentic AI pipeline designed to diagnose and correct physical 
quantum hardware errors, effectively reducing calibration time from hours to seconds. 
Trained a custom supervised learning model on synthetically generated circuit data, 
achieving 85% diagnostic accuracy across five distinct error categories including stochastic 
noise and crosstalk. Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using a 
local Gemma-3 LLM to dynamically generate hardware-aware circuit patches based on 
classified faults. Implemented a closed-loop control architecture with a secondary "Critic" 
agent to logically validate repairs, establishing a robust pre-flight calibration protocol for 
quantum processors.• Technologies: LangChain, Gemma-3 (Local LLM), RAG, PyTorch, Synthetic Data
